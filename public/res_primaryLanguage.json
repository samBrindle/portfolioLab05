After building a computer while I was attendinf the University of Iowa, I found myself coding in my free time which led to me deciding I wanted a career in programming. I primarily work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React in my course but I also know Python and Java. I have a drive learning and enjoy being challenged with new tasks.",
